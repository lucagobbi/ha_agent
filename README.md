HA Agent is a Cheshire Cat plugin that connects the Cat to your HomeAssistant instance,
letting you embrace the power of LLMs to control your home devices with natural language.

## Configuration

Once you have installed the plugin through the Cheshire Cat admin panel, you need to do some configuration before talking to the Cat.

First of all, you can choose whether the plugin is working in a HA addon environment. If this is true you don't need to configure the HA instance URL and Auth Token because the plugin will handle the communication with Home Assistant directly.
Otherwise, be sure to point to your HA installation (e.g. http://homeassistant.local:8123) and provide a valid token to authenticate requests to Home Assistant APIs.

Now it's time to choose what services and entities you want the Cat to be able to control.
